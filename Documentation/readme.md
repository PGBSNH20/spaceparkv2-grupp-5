# SpacePark
Welcome to our SpacePark API! It's an ASP.NET Core Web API that we will implement into an application for our business SpacePark, the biggest parking company in the Milky Way! You're more than happy to study our API, do pull requests and download to customize for educational purposes. However if you try to outcompete our business we will sue you.

## Features
The API is created to handle VICs (Very Important Characters) from the Star Wars movies and their space ships at various space ports around our galaxy (and maybe even further). Of course it's only digital, COVID-friendly and the customer can use the API without any physical support. The customer registrates themselves at arriving, then they can add a parking (which will check if the customer is a valid VIC, if there's any available parking spots and if their space ship fits, sorry Death Star). If everything goes smooth the parking starts and the customer doesn't have do to anything until they leave, then they will add a payment by enter their parking id. The API will subtract the arrival time from the current time and 
You can probably make it work for other types of vehicles, for example cars on planets.
